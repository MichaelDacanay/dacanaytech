		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>
			As of Fall 2019, I am a first year student at NC State University, majoring in Computer Science. I enjoy spending time with my family and meeting new friends. My current interests in the field of computer science include building iOS apps, Python, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and AWS.

			Hello! My name is Michael Dacanay. I born and raised in Raleigh, North Carolina. I am 19 years old. At Shodor, I am an apprentice during the 2016-2017 year.  I joined Shodor to learn more about computer science, gain essential office and life skills. This year I have had a great time at Shodor.  I met many new friends and they are so inspiring.  They are skilled in one way or another and I can't wait to continue being friends. As apprentices, we learn about new languages and software like php, html, mysql, css, vensim, agentcubes, gimp, inkscape, and linux.  Using what we have learned, I completed various projects. This experience at Shodor is very memorable.  I hope to be an intern at Shodor next year. The atmosphere was lively and joyful whenever we play cards during our breaks. It is always a great stress-reliever.

			This coming school year, I will be a junior (11th grade). I will be taking calculus ab and bc, environmental science, english III, us history, spanish I, and orchestra. Math and orchestra are my two favorite subjects in school. At school, I am involved in Key club, National Honors Society, National Society of High School Scholars, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Executive Council, and Model UN.
		</p>
		<p>
			I enjoy spending time with my friends and family. Recently, we went to China, which was really fun! We visited Beijing, Xi An, Wu Han, Jing Zhou, the Yang Tze River, Chong Qing, and Shang Hai. We saw many world heritage sites, among them were the Great Wall of China, Terricotta Warriors, the Temple of Heavenly Peace, the Red Pagoda, and so much more. I especially loved seeing the Panda bears in Chong Qing. This was a wonderful global experience.

			In my free time, I enjoy playing cello. I have played this instrument for about five years. I started playing it in 6th grade and ever since, my passion for cello has continued. In my years of playing cello, I was part Sinfonia, Triangle Youth Orchestra, NC Film Orchestra, North Carolina Chamber Institute (Ritornello Piano Quartet), Melos, and Leesville Chamber Orchestra. One of my favorite pieces to perform is Seitz Piano Quartet Op. 35.  It is elegant and combines different technicalities.  Another stirring piece is Seitz' Concerto No. 3 in G minor for the violin. My sister is currently playing it and I can't wait until she perfects it because it sounds amazing.
		</p>
		<p>
			My favorite sport is basketball. When I was born I already knew that I loved basketball. Another of my passions, is the game of chess. In my elementary years, my friends and I really enjoyed participating at local tournaments.  I enjoy going to youth group with my friends during Wednesdays. Last but not least, I am very thankful to my family.  They are very loving and supportive.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the future, I hope to be able to continue after my dad and work at SAS. Also, my dream one day is to start my own company and my life's purpose is to make a positive impact on the people around me.
